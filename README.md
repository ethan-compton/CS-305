Module Eight Portfolio
1. Brief Summary:
Artemis Financial is a company focused on financial services that requires secure software to protect sensitive client data. They needed help identifying and resolving software security vulnerabilities in their internal application. The main issue they wanted addressed was potential weaknesses in their code that could be exploited, especially regarding data validation and access control.

2. What I Did Well / Importance of Security:
One thing I did well was identifying insecure input handling that could have led to injection attacks. I used code review and static analysis to pinpoint where data wasn’t being properly sanitized. Secure coding is critical because even a small vulnerability can be exploited, leading to data loss or reputation damage. Strong security builds trust with users and protects the company’s bottom line.

3. Challenging/Helpful Part:
The most challenging part was learning how to interpret the output from security tools and understanding which issues were the most urgent to fix. However, it was also the most helpful, as it taught me how to prioritize vulnerabilities and approach them with practical solutions.

4. Increasing Security Layers / Mitigation Techniques:
To increase security, I added input validation, encrypted sensitive data, and improved authentication logic. In the future, I would continue using threat modeling, code scanning tools, and penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities and guide mitigation choices.

5. Functional and Secure Code / New Vulnerabilities:
After refactoring, I retested the application using both manual test cases and automated tools to ensure everything still worked and that I hadn’t introduced new issues. I focused on edge cases and areas that had previously been vulnerable.

6. Resources and Tools Used:
I used OWASP guidelines, static analysis tools like SonarQube, and secure coding best practices as references throughout the process. These resources will definitely be helpful in future projects to identify risks early.

7. What Employers Might See:
Future employers will be able to see that I completed a real-world vulnerability assessment and improved an application’s security. This shows I can not only write code but also maintain secure development practices, analyze risks, and implement effective solutions.
